<p>Naming things is hard, Hadley wickham makes this point in his book</p>

<h1>Naming Packages</h1>
<p>I was recently at the rOpenSci Unconf in the USA, and Noam Ross made the point that there are a few different ways to thing about naming packages in R, which he described fell into three styles, the oldschool, the modern, and the post modern.</p>
<div id="the-oldschool-mixedcasers" class="section level2">
<h2>The oldschool (mixedCaseRs)</h2>
<p>The oldSchool namer generally mixes case in an R package, often capitalising the “R”.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="">twitteR</a></li>
<li><a href="">formatR</a></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-modern-lowercasers" class="section level2">
<h2>The Modern (lowercasers)</h2>
<p>The modern namer has everything in lowercase and carefully places an <code>r</code>. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>dplyr</li>
<li>tidyr</li>
<li></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="the-post-modern-names" class="section level2">
<h2>The Post Modern (names)</h2>
<p>This involves using just the original name, as is. This name must also be a thing.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>broom</li>
<li>checkers</li>
<li>narnia</li>
<li>forecast</li>
<li>reshape</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h1>How to make a name?</h1>
<p>Coming up with package name is usually really hard. A lot of thought goes into it. Personally I’ve changed the names of the packages <code>visdat</code> and <code>narnia</code> three times. <code>visdat</code> was initially <a href="https://github.com/njtierney/visdat/commit/a350e50d210ab99939b53b22e2e2013e7e492f80"><code>footprintr</code></a>, then <code>vizdat</code>, and then finally <code>visdat</code>. <code>narnia</code> was initiallly <a href="https://github.com/njtierney/narnia/commit/a161b7c5707e0c5041467d8f7228c11afb5e2b29"><code>ggmissing</code></a>, then <code>naniar</code>, then finally <code>naniar</code>.</p>
<p>I find that I generally need to sit on a name for a while and use it, describe it to a few people. I find that once I state the name of the package to them, they often have to ask how to spell it, and if that process feels difficult multiple times, and if I can’t work out how to explain why I named it that, then I generally try and rename it. Often this comes down to a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the package name hard to say?</li>
<li>Is the</li>
</ul>
<p>Nowadays, I would look at the <code>available</code> package for checking if the name exists, and it might even one day come up with something really creative or unusual.</p>
<p>Hadley has a great guide to naming packages, but this process is generally hard.</p>
