title: About Me
---

My name is Nick Tierney. I did my undergrad and honours in Psych, and then took an unconventional turn, and did a PhD in Statistics (under [Kerrie Mengersen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerrie_Mengersen)) in 2018. I now work as a research software engineer with [Nick Golding](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/contact-us/our-people/g/nick-golding/) at the [Telethon Kids Institute](https://www.telethonkids.org.au/), in Perth, Western Australia. I work on improving and maintaining the [greta](https://greta-stats.org/) R package for statistical modelling, and implementing workflows to automate analysis on diseases like COVID19 and malaria.

Previously I was at Monash University (2017-2020), working as a research fellow, then lecturer. I worked with [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/) in the [NUMBAT group](https://numbat.space/), and taught [ETC1010, introduction to Data Analysis](https://dmac.netlify.org/).

My research focusses on improving data analysis. This includes exploratory data analysis, statistical modelling, diagnostics, and understanding how colour choice can impact decision making. 

I believe in free and open source software, and have written several R packages to improve data analysis. These can be seen on my [software page](http://njtierney.com/software). Some R packages I am quite proud of are ([`visdat`](https://github.com/njtierney/visdat)) for preliminary exploration of data, and [`naniar`](https://naniar.njtierney.com/), for improving working with and exploring missing data.

I have also created an optimisation model that identifies and possibly relocates facilities to maximise their coverage on a population, in the R package [`maxcovr`](https://github.com/njtierney/maxcovr), and am interested in testing if commonly used diagnostics for MCMC methods are used effectively by researchers.

I love the [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and how it has transformed my world. I am a proud member of the [rOpenSci](https://ropensci.org/) community, a collective that works to make science open using R. I was the lead organiser of the rOpenSci ozunconf for [2016](https://auunconf.ropensci.org/), [2017](https://ozunconf17.ropensci.org/), and [2018](https://ozunconf18.ropensci.org/).

I also co-host a podcast with [Saskia Freytag](https://twitter.com/trashystats) about everything #rstats named  ["Credibly Curious"](https://soundcloud.com/crediblycurious).

I am always up for questions about anything to do with R and stats. I was really fortunate to have some really kind people show me the ways of R and statistics, and I want to help people in the same way.

This website exists so I can write about what I do and engage in dialogue with statisticians, programmers, and whoever else is interested. 

I am a keen outdoors person, and love hiking and rock climbing. I recently hiked 300K of the Australian Alpine Walking Track, a very rugged adventure, especially when hiking solo.

Over the past years I have MC'd at national and state level climbing competitions, here is a photo of me MCing at the Australian national lead climbing championships in 2015 in Brisbane.

I enjoy photography, and have taken some [not-terrible photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134851297@N04) of other climbers:

And have also been getting into film photography, which you can follow on my [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/njtierney).

I occasionally play guitar, love karaoke, and am a coffee geek.

This website has moved from wordpress, to [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), and uses a(n increasingly further) tweaked version of Yihui's beautiful [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin) theme.
