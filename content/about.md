My name is Nick Tierney. I am a Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University under the supervision of [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) and [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/). My research is currently about making better tools to wrangle missing data, which include [narnia](https://github.com/njtierney/narnia) and [visdat](https://github.com/njtierney/visdat).

This website exists so I can write about what I do and engage in dialogue with statisticians, programmers, and whoever else is interested. When I write R related posts, they are syndicated on [R-bloggers](http://www.r-bloggers.com/).

Outside of research, I enjoy rock climbing, playing guitar, [taking photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134851297@N04), and making and drinking coffee.

I've recently moved my website from [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), and am using a slightly tweaked version of Yihui's awesome minimal theme, [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin).
