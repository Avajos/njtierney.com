title: About Me
---

My name is Nick Tierney. I am a Research Fellow in Statistics at Monash University under the supervision of [Rob Hyndman](https://robjhyndman.com/) and [Di Cook](http://dicook.org/). My research is currently about making better tools to explore, wrangle, and model missing data. This has resulted in two R packages [narnia](https://github.com/njtierney/narnia) and [visdat](https://github.com/njtierney/visdat). I’m also very interested in Bayesian statistics, decision trees, and multilevel linear models.

I love the R language and how it has transformed my world. 

I feel super lucky to be a part of the rOpenSci community, which has similarly had a great positive impact on my life!

I am always up for questions about anything to do with R and stats. 5 years ago I hadn’t programmed in R at all, and was just finishing my undergrad in psych - I was really fortunate to have some really kind people show me the ways of R and statistics, and I want to make sure I can help people in the same way.

This website exists so I can write about what I do and engage in dialogue with statisticians, programmers, and whoever else is interested. 

I am a keen rock climber and enjoy being involved in the climbing community. Over the past years I have MC'd at national and state level climbing competitions, here is a photo of me MCing at the Australian national lead climbing championships in 2015 in Brisbane.

I enjoy photography, and have taken some [not-terrible photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/134851297@N04) of other climbers:

I ocassionaly play guitar, I love karaoke, and am a coffee geek.

This website has moved from [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) to [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), and am using a slightly tweaked version of Yihui's awesome minimal theme, [hugo-xmin](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-xmin).
