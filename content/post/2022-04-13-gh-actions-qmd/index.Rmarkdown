I have just successfully transferred ["rmarkdown for scientists"](https://rmd4sci.njtierney.com/) book to use quarto, creating ["quarto for scientists"](https://github.com/njtierney/qmd4sci).

What I want is for the book to âœ¨ automagically âœ¨ update when I push changes.

The alternative is to render the book, and then push all of the HTML files that are created on each change. The reason I do not want to do this is that the files get a bit big - around about 2.4Mb currently. And then, each time I make changes to the markdown files, I also need to update the HTML files. This is a duplication of effort - all I care about is the markdown, and I want a computer, somewhere, to do the fancy rendering to HTML.

Thankfully, there is a way to do this! GitHub Actions is the way. Briefly, GitHub Actions allow you to run code when you push it onto github. For example, say you want to do a spell check every time you push a text document, you can create a github action to check the spelling. This concept of having a service that runs some checks when you give it some code, is referred to as [continuous integration (CI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration).

So, here are some notes on getting quarto to render with github actions.

# Step 1: `use_github_action(â€¦)`

You can create your own github actions from scratch, but instead, what we are going to do is use some already made github actions from the quarto team. They have very kindly made some github actions available that help set up quarto, and render a document and put it online.

I ran the following:

``` r
use_github_action(url = "https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/quarto-book-netlify.yaml")
```

Which you can see at [this commit](https://github.com/njtierney/qmd4sci/pull/1/commits/dc26646fc6a06c8f46a2b71683add9259e4518de).

This creates a `.github` folder, which contains a `workflows` folder, and the `quarto-book-netlify.yaml` file.

I then needed to change the directory that I had my quarto HTML files rendering to ([this commit](https://github.com/njtierney/qmd4sci/pull/1/commits/70c1d1d62a152ea50aa88b7ce0006727240b1a04)). This is where it puts the HTML files that it renders when you run `quarto preview` . I had changed mine to be "docs" in the [`_quarto.yml` file here](https://github.com/njtierney/qmd4sci/blob/master/_quarto.yml#L3). So this part of the github action changed:

``` yaml
      - name: Deploy to Netlify
        id: netlify-deploy
        uses: nwtgck/actions-netlify@v1
        with:
          # The folder the action should deploy. Adapt if you changed in Quarto config
          publish-dir: './docs' # <<< THIS PART HERE
          production-branch: main
```

Rather helpfully, the [quarto-dev/quarto-actions repo has examples](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/tree/main/examples) of setting up a quarto book:

So now I'm just going to walk you through these next steps.

# using netlify token

Clicking the link to ["personal access tokens"](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens) that the README provides takes me to a page like this (after logging into netlify) and click on "new access token":

![](images/paste-1D9C9F5D.png)

Which takes you to this page, where you enter a personal access token description:

![](images/paste-013822C4.png)

Enter a description of your token - in my case, "qmd4sci", and click "generate token", you will then be given a token, which I have blurred out here:

![](images/paste-0C56E447.png)

Then we go back to the README, to see we need to follow the following:

![](images/paste-308B2C37-2.png)

[Team page](https://app.netlify.com/teams/njtierney/overview) \>\>

![](images/paste-AB066CB5-1.png)

Your site \>\>

In this case, I hadn't added it to netlify, so I needed to click "add new site", "import an existing project"

![](images/paste-CFF5AF55.png)

Then, "connect to a git provider" - I selected "github"

![](images/paste-E79099BE.png)

It then displays a message that says, "authorized", or you need to authorize/log in to github.

Then you need to pick the repo you want to use from github. Personally, I manually configure this each time, so I need to go to, "can't see your repo here? Configure the Netlify app on GitHub"

![](images/paste-5BE3CF5F.png)

Which takes me to a GitHub page of organisations I am a part of, I choose my repo name and confirm my GitHub password

![](images/paste-25A984DA.png)

I then get taken to a page like so:

![](images/paste-F476262F.png)

And I scroll to the bottom and search for the repo I want, and save it:

![](images/paste-B8472831.png)

OK, so once that is done, we are back here:

![](images/paste-359F0D7A.png)

I select qmd4sci, then tell is where I want the base directory to be, which is in your `_quarto.yaml` file, in my case, it is `docs`

![](images/paste-33678FCA.png)

(the directory you want to publish the book into is in "output-dir" in your `_quarto.yml` file, and looks like this:

``` yaml
project: 
  type: "book"
  output-dir: docs # THIS ONE HERE
```

Then, you should be taken to a page like this:

![](images/paste-5558F32F.png)

You'll see that my site deploy failed here - at the time I thought this was because I needed to rename my branch from master to main (which, by the way, is quite trivial now! Run `usethis::git_default_branch_rename()` see more details in the tidyverse blog post, ["renaming the default branch"](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2021/10/renaming-default-branch/)).

It also turned out that there were some other errors I needed to iron out. Which is partly why I am writing this blogpost, so I can show how I ironed out the kinks, because this is kinda hard.

So, to work through this, I copied some of the relevant YAML from the [rstudio/r-manuals repo](https://github.com/rstudio/r-manuals/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-website.yaml) :

``` yaml
      - name: Put pandoc in PATH
        run: |
          mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
          ln -s $(dirname $(readlink -f  $(which quarto)))"/pandoc" ~/.local/bin/pandoc
        shell: bash

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          use-public-rspm: true

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
```

(this commit)

OK and it turns out that in order to do that I needed to set up a renv.lock file, which essentially tells me the dependencies are needed. We can do this with:

```{r}
renv::init()
```

Which will create a file called `renv.lock` and the output will look something like this:

![](images/paste-1699D8BE.png)

Somewhat annoyingly then I have a bunch of stuff in my git repo that I don't care about or want:

# And then, I ran into ðŸ‘» weird ðŸ‘» github actions errors and didn't return to this blogpost for 2 months

[The error](https://github.com/njtierney/qmd4sci/runs/6037540369?check_suite_focus=true) I was running into was on github actions said:

    ------------------------- ANTICONF ERROR ---------------------------
    Configuration failed because libcurl was not found. Try installing:
     * deb: libcurl4-openssl-dev (Debian, Ubuntu, etc)
     * rpm: libcurl-devel (Fedora, CentOS, RHEL)
     * csw: libcurl_dev (Solaris)
    If libcurl is already installed, check that 'pkg-config' is in your
    PATH and PKG_CONFIG_PATH contains a libcurl.pc file. If pkg-config
    is unavailable you can set INCLUDE_DIR and LIB_DIR manually via:
    R CMD INSTALL --configure-vars='INCLUDE_DIR=... LIB_DIR=...'
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    ERROR: configuration failed for package â€˜curlâ€™

        })

     3: r_cmd_install(package, path)
     2: r_exec_error(package, output, "install", status)
     1: stop(error)
    Execution halted
    Error: Process completed with exit code 1.

So, the first thing I did was "delete all logs"

![](images/paste-4C88B276.png)

Which, in the past has helped me resolve some strange github actions behaviour.

I then made a tiny change to the github actions file to trigger the build again...which was to comment out the "workflow_dispatch:" part of github actions, because I am not sure what that does...

    on:
      push:
        branches: main
      pull_request:
        branches: main
      # to be able to trigger a manual build
      # workflow_dispatch:

That...didn't work.

But quarto works for heaps of people...so now it's time to look at how other people use quarto books.

Let's look at [R for data science](https://github.com/hadley/r4ds/blob/main/.github/workflows/quarto-book-netlify.yaml) - I'll copy this and compare it to mine, making a couple of small changes.

I made that [change here](https://github.com/njtierney/qmd4sci/commit/33d0eaef79235e065394f27221d471a7e494538e).

And my god, it worked.

OK, so what changed?

I think the main thing that did it, was replacing

``` yaml
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-renv@v2
```

with

``` yaml
- uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
```

Which means my whole theory about renv probably wasn't true.

OK, wow so this is a long, long journey, and I'm sorry that I don't have the tidy solution I was hoping I could have. I'm going to tidy up the YAML now and hopefully be back with an example that actually works, then I can step through that, and we can forget all the mistakes I made.

Hopefully these errors are instructive. Yes, someone who has worked with R for 9 years, has written a short book about rmarkdown, many R packages, etc etc., is still trying to figure out how it all works. We're all learning. Well, I'm always learning new things at least.

# I figured it out

OK, so I figured it out!

Hooray!

Sort of. I now need to probably write another blog post that goes through the same details but much much cleaner. Here's the general gist:

-   All of the authentication with github and netlify etc, with the secret tokens still needs to happen

-   Copy the YAML from here: <https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/quarto-book-netlify.yaml> - or run:

``` r
usethis::use_github_action(
  url = "https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-actions/blob/main/examples/quarto-book-netlify.yaml"
)
```

-   Add this code into tha YAML file where the comment says, "Install any computing dependency you may need, usually either python and Jupyter or R".

``` yaml
      # Install any computing dependency you may need, usually either python and Jupyter or R
      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          use-public-rspm: true

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
```

-   push these changes

![](images/paste-89425B62.png)

Hooray!

You don't need renv at all. I'm not sure why I thought that. But hopefully I haven't done something spooky where the details of the renv are somehow cached somewhere on github actions. I'll test this out with another book I'm working on and report back when/if I get to writing the cleaner version of this blog post.

# But how do we see the website?

Let's check netlify.

Turns out I must have deleted the original website I made above for qmd4sci. I recreated it, following the same steps, and...

...

it failed.

Because I forgot the steps above about setting the NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN and the NETLIFY_SITE_ID

I must have had a brain malfunction.

Let's do the SITE_ID one first:

![](images/show-site-id.png)

So go to the site details, site information, and click site ID and copy the code here

![](images/paste-23CA04C4.png)

Then, on github, go to:

Settings \>\> secrets \>\> actions \>\> new repository secret

![](images/paste-265D855B.png)

Then, remember back to the YAML file, where we've got these two secrets:

``` yaml
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

So now we name the `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`, and paste in the SITE ID from netlify

![](images/paste-1E0C8511.png)

Then, get your personal access token from [here](https://app.netlify.com/user/applications#personal-access-tokens), and click "new access token" - this is shown above.

Then go back and create a new secret, but call it `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`

Then I went back and changed something tiny and pushed the change to trigger a new build.

*hold on to your butts*

It worked! Eventually. I had to wait a little bit.

(I also realised that I tried to turn on github pages, which you don't need to do, since it pushes straight to netlify)
