Things are moving along in the COVID19 world in Melbourne, and the latest numbers we are discussing are the 14 day and 7 day averages. The aim is to get the 14 day average below 5 cases, but people are starting to report the current 7 day average, since this is also encouraging and interesting.

So let's explore how to do sliding averages. We'll [use the covid scraping code from a previous blog post on scraping covid data](https://www.njtierney.com/post/2020/10/11/times-scales-covid/) (I don't think I'll put this into yet another R package, but I'm tempted. But...anyway).

This code checks if we can scrape the data (`bow()`), scrapes the data (`scrape()`), extracts the tables (`html_table()`), picks (`pluck`) the second one, then converts it to a `tibble` for nice printing.

```{r covid-raw}
covidlive_url <- "https://covidlive.com.au/report/daily-cases/vic"

covidlive_raw <- covidlive_url %>% 
  bow() %>% 
  scrape() %>% 
  html_table() %>% 
  pluck(2) %>% 
  as_tibble()
```

Then we do a bit of data cleaning, parsing the dates and numbers properly, and just leaving us with a date and case column:

```{r covid-cases}

strp_date <- function(x) as.Date(strptime(x, format = "%d %b"))

daily_cases <- covidlive_raw %>% 
  mutate(DATE = strp_date(DATE),
         CASES = parse_number(CASES),
         NET = suppressWarnings(parse_number(NET))) %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  select(-var,
         -cases) %>% 
  rename(cases = net) %>% 
  select(date, cases)

daily_cases
```

We can then convert this into a [`tsibble`](https://github.com/tidyverts/tsibble), to make it easier to work with dates.

```{r daily-ts}
daily_ts <- as_tsibble(daily_cases,
                       index = date)
```

## Sliding windows?

No we want to plot a 7 and 14 day average of cases. Thinking about how I would do this, I probably would have identified the "week" of a year, and then grouped by that and calculated the average, and maybe through some `reduce`/`aggregate` functional programming magic.

But there is now a more straightforward way, using using the [{`slider`}](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/) R package by [Davis Vaughn](https://github.com/DavisVaughan). This package allows for performing calculations on a specified window size. The idea is very powerful, and was in part [inspired by](https://github.com/DavisVaughan/slider#inspiration) the `slide` family of functions in `tsibble`. 

[Earo Wang](https://earo.me/) has given some really nice explanations of what sliding is, in particular I like her [JSM19 talk](https://slides.earo.me/jsm19/#23) and [rstudioconf::2019 talk](https://slides.earo.me/rstudioconf19/#15) - a visual representation is in this gif (lifted from Earo's talk):

```{r earo-gif, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tsibble.tidyverts.org/reference/figures/animate-1.gif")
```

slider provides a more general interface, and draws upon the framework in `purrr` and `vctrs` R packages. 

Let's show an example by taking the last 14 days of covid cases

```{r vec-cases}
vec_cases <- daily_ts %>% 
  tail(15) %>% 
  pull(cases) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  as.numeric()
  
vec_cases
```

We can use `slide` to calculate the mean of the last 7 days. We can demonstrate how this work by first just printing the data, and using the `.before = 6`, to print the previous 6 values, plus the current one:

```{r demo-slide}
slide(.x = vec_cases, 
      .f = ~.x,
      .before = 6)
```

This shows us 14 lists, the first 6 containing 1-6 of the numbers, then 7 from thereout.

We can instead run a function, like `mean` to calculate the mean on this output. 

```{r demo-slide-mean}
slide(.x = vec_cases,
      .f = mean,
      .before = 7)
```

We can even use the `slide_dbl` function to return these as all numeric (the type stability feature borrowed from purrr):

```{r demo-slide-mean-dbl}
slide_dbl(.x = vec_cases,
          .f = mean,
          .before = 7)
```

Now let's use this inside our data, first we filter the data down to from the start of october with `filter_index("2020-10-01" ~ .)`, then, we calculate the average, using `slide_index_dbl`, where we specify the time index used in the data with `i`:

```{r covid-rolls}
covid_rolls <- daily_ts %>% 
  filter_index("2020-10-01" ~ .) %>% 
  mutate(`7 day avg` = slide_index_dbl(.i = date,
                                .x = cases,
                                .f = mean,
                                .before = 6),
         `14 day avg` = slide_index_dbl(.i = date,
                                   .x = cases,
                                   .f = mean,
                                   .before = 13))

covid_rolls
```

We convert this into long form for easier plotting

```{r covid-rolls-long}
covid_rolls_long <- covid_rolls %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = 3:4,
               names_to = "roll_type",
               values_to = "value")
covid_rolls_long
```

Now let's plot it!

```{r plot-covid-rolls-long}
ggplot(covid_rolls_long,
       aes(x = date,
           y = value,
           colour = roll_type)) + 
  geom_line() +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 5, linetype = 2) + 
  lims(y = c(0, 15)) +
  scale_colour_discrete_qualitative() +
  labs(x = "Date",
       y = "Rolling Average",
       colour = "Average") +
  # make the legend inset using code lifted from 
  # https://github.com/MilesMcBain/inlegend/blob/master/R/legends.R
  theme(legend.justification = c(1, 1),
        legend.position = c(1.0, 1),
        legend.background = ggplot2::element_rect(
          colour = "#d3d5d6",
          fill = "#ffffff",
          size = 0.6
        ))

```

# End

The `slider` R package is really neat, and there is more to say about it! But I just thought I'd finish by saying that it is indeed possible to do the same "stretch" and "tile" manouevers as provided by `tsibble`, and I would highly recommend checking out the [slider website](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/) for more details on examples like rolling linear models and how to use it to [perform row wise iteration](https://davisvaughan.github.io/slider/articles/rowwise.html).
