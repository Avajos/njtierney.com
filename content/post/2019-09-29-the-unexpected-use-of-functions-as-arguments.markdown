I think that I have learnt and forgotten, and then learnt about this feature of R a few times in the past 4 years. The idea (I think), is this: 

> 1. R allows you to pass functions as arguments
> 2. Functions can be modified inside a function

So what the hell does that mean?

Well, I think I can summarise it down to this _crazy piece of magic:_


```r
my_fun <- function(x, fun){
  fun(x)
}
```

Now we can pass in some input, and _any_ function.

Let's take the `storms` data from `dplyr`.


```r
library(dplyr)
```

```
## 
## Attaching package: 'dplyr'
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:stats':
## 
##     filter, lag
```

```
## The following objects are masked from 'package:base':
## 
##     intersect, setdiff, setequal, union
```

```r
storms
```

```
## # A tibble: 10,010 x 13
##    name   year month   day  hour   lat  long status category  wind pressure
##    <chr> <dbl> <dbl> <int> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <chr>  <ord>    <int>    <int>

##  3 Amy    1975     6    27    12  29.5 -79   tropi… -1          25     1013

##  5 Amy    1975     6    28     0  31.5 -78.8 tropi… -1          25     1012
##  6 Amy    1975     6    28     6  32.4 -78.7 tropi… -1          25     1012
##  7 Amy    1975     6    28    12  33.3 -78   tropi… -1          25     1011
##  8 Amy    1975     6    28    18  34   -77   tropi… -1          30     1006
##  9 Amy    1975     6    29     0  34.4 -75.8 tropi… 0           35     1004
## 10 Amy    1975     6    29     6  34   -74.8 tropi… 0           40     1002
## # … with 10,000 more rows, and 2 more variables: ts_diameter <dbl>,
## #   hu_diameter <dbl>
```

Let's take the mean of `wind`:


```r
my_fun(storms$wind, mean)
```

```
## [1] 53.495
```

And, we can also do the standard deviation, or the variance, or the median


```r
my_fun(storms$wind, sd)
```

```
## [1] 26.21387
```

```r
my_fun(storms$wind, var)
```

```
## [1] 687.1668
```

```r
my_fun(storms$wind, median)
```

```
## [1] 45
```

# Why would you want to do this?

Let's say you want to summarise the `storms` data further, for each month.

We take storms, group my month, then take the mean for month.


```r
storms %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(wind_summary = mean(wind))
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <dbl>
##  1     1         45.7
##  2     4         44.6
##  3     5         36.3
##  4     6         37.8
##  5     7         41.2
##  6     8         52.1
##  7     9         58.0
##  8    10         54.6
##  9    11         52.5
## 10    12         47.9
```

You could repeat the code again you could vary `mean` to be, say `sd`


```r
storms %>% 
  group_by(month) %>%
  summarise(wind_summary = sd(wind))
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <dbl>
##  1     1         9.08
##  2     4         5.94
##  3     5         9.57
##  4     6        13.4 
##  5     7        19.1 
##  6     8        26.0 
##  7     9        28.2 
##  8    10        25.3 
##  9    11        22.0 
## 10    12        14.6
```

Over the years, every time I repeat some code like this, I have felt a tug somewhere in my brain - a little spidey sense saying (something like): "Don't repeat yourself, Nick". 

We can avoid repeating ourselves by using the template from earlier here in dplyr. We want to manipulate the summary (mean) used - so you could also take the median, variance, etc. 

We can write the following:


```r
storms_wind_summary <- function(fun){
  storms %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise(wind_summary = fun(wind))
}
```

And now we can pass the function name, say, mean.


```r
storms_wind_summary(mean)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <dbl>
##  1     1         45.7
##  2     4         44.6
##  3     5         36.3
##  4     6         37.8
##  5     7         41.2
##  6     8         52.1
##  7     9         58.0
##  8    10         54.6
##  9    11         52.5
## 10    12         47.9
```

Or, any other function!


```r
storms_wind_summary(sd)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <dbl>
##  1     1         9.08
##  2     4         5.94
##  3     5         9.57
##  4     6        13.4 
##  5     7        19.1 
##  6     8        26.0 
##  7     9        28.2 
##  8    10        25.3 
##  9    11        22.0 
## 10    12        14.6
```

```r
storms_wind_summary(var)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <dbl>
##  1     1         82.5
##  2     4         35.3
##  3     5         91.5
##  4     6        180. 
##  5     7        365. 
##  6     8        678. 
##  7     9        793. 
##  8    10        638. 
##  9    11        482. 
## 10    12        213.
```

```r
storms_wind_summary(median)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <dbl>
##  1     1         50  
##  2     4         45  
##  3     5         35  
##  4     6         35  
##  5     7         37.5
##  6     8         45  
##  7     9         50  
##  8    10         50  
##  9    11         50  
## 10    12         45
```

We could even make our own!


```r
range_diff <- function(x){
  diff(range(x))
}
  
storms_wind_summary(range_diff)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month wind_summary
##    <dbl>        <int>
##  1     1           25
##  2     4           15
##  3     5           35
##  4     6           70
##  5     7          130
##  6     8          140
##  7     9          145
##  8    10          145
##  9    11          120
## 10    12           50
```

Looks like there was a pretty huge range in July through to November!

Pretty neat, eh? You can manipulate the function itself!

# Going slightly further

The above was an example demonstrating _how_ you can manipulate a function being passed.

But, there are other ways to do this with dplyr that I might use instead.
We could use `summarise_at` here, to specify a function in a different, equivalent, way.


```r
storms_wind_summary <- function(fun){
  storms %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise_at(.vars = vars(wind),
                 .funs = list(fun))
}

storms_wind_summary(mean)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month  wind
##    <dbl> <dbl>
##  1     1  45.7
##  2     4  44.6
##  3     5  36.3
##  4     6  37.8
##  5     7  41.2
##  6     8  52.1
##  7     9  58.0
##  8    10  54.6
##  9    11  52.5
## 10    12  47.9
```

```r
storms_wind_summary(median)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 2
##    month  wind
##    <dbl> <dbl>
##  1     1  50  
##  2     4  45  
##  3     5  35  
##  4     6  35  
##  5     7  37.5
##  6     8  45  
##  7     9  50  
##  8    10  50  
##  9    11  50  
## 10    12  45
```

What if we want to provide many functions? Say, the mean, median, sd, variance, all together, how they belong?

We can do this.

This is done by passing dots (ellipsis) `...` to the function. This allows for any number of inputs. 


```r
storms_wind_summary <- function(...){
  storms %>%
    group_by(month) %>%
    summarise_at(.vars = vars(wind),
                 .funs = list(...))
}


storms_wind_summary(median, mean, max)
```

```
## # A tibble: 10 x 4
##    month   fn1   fn2   fn3
##    <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <int>
##  1     1  50    45.7    55
##  2     4  45    44.6    50
##  3     5  35    36.3    60
##  4     6  35    37.8    80
##  5     7  37.5  41.2   140
##  6     8  45    52.1   150
##  7     9  50    58.0   160
##  8    10  50    54.6   160
##  9    11  50    52.5   135
## 10    12  45    47.9    75
```

# What's the point of this?

So, this might not be the most useful summary of the `storms` data...and writing functions like this might not be the most general usecase. `dplyr` provides some amazingly flexible syntax to summarise data. Sometimes the answer isn't writing a function, and you want to be mindful of replicating the flexibility of `dplyr` itself.

That said, with a task like this, or any section of code, I really think it can be useful to wrap them in a function, which _describes more broadly what that section does_. And, with features like what I wrote about here, I think that you can more clearly and flexible wrap up these features for your own use.

R is flexible enough to make that quite straightforward, and I think that is pretty darn neat!

# Fin

Go forth, and use the power of functions in your work!

# PS

Upon reflection, I'm pretty sure [Mitchell O'Hara-Wild](mitchoharawild?) was the one who helped really solidify this into my brain. Thanks, Mitch!
