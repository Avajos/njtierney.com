Recently on Twitter I saw [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc) post this guide to slide design by [Melinda Seckington](https://twitter.com/mseckington)

{{< tweet 891372076010946560 >}}

I feel very strongly about good design of slides, and this slidedeck does a really great job of discussing good principles in a digestible manner, stating that the goal of a presentation is:

> To allow your audience to absort your information.

It then goes on to describe 4 excellent principles of slide design, which I won't repeat here - you should go through the slides and read them, like, right now. They are excellent.

BUT, if I were to take one thing from the presentation to recommend it would be this:

> Focus on one purpose per slide

> Don't distract

I find it very frustrating when a speaker loads up a page full of points that seem to exist to remind them what to say. Instead, key points should be separated into individual slides, EVEN IF it means that you have upwards of 60 sparse slides for a 15 minute talk, this is far better than 15 information dense slides.

# What to build slides in?

I really like using [Yihui Xie's](https://yihui.name) rmarkdown slide package, [`xaringan`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan), it is simple, quick, and fun.

However, I think that to fully use all of the techniques described in "The Art of Slide Design", you will be better off using WYSIWYG presentation software like powerpoint or keynote. To get the same degree of exact placement of figures/text/fonts on a html slide deck I feel like I would fall down a rabbithole of HTML/CSS/JS. Going down this rabbithole can be fine sometimes, but I would rather focus on the talk. 

That being said, it is entirely possible that there are some tools or tricks that make it easier to get the control I want in HTML/CSS/JS, if so, I'm keen to hear about them!
