Sometimes people are fond of saying:

> Well, _you know_, the thing with statistics is that you can get the statistics to say whatever you want.

I think that this is the equivalent of saying:

>...What I am saying is true because of my argument.

You can _say_ that anything is true, but what really matters is the **strength of your argument.**

And statistics...

The same goes for statistics, you could perform a variety of tests to support a particular point.

However, your argument depends on the suitability of your statistical test for what you are **trying to prove or demonstrate**

Statistics are used to articulate a particular point. The author has the responsibility of ensuring they are **correctly** using a statistic to prove this point.

The reader also has a responsibility to evaluate their use of tools to construct and support their argument.

So yes, statistics could be used to support the argument

> Johnny steals tim tams from Nick, as he has done this a statistically significant number of times.

Upon reading this, one should be very keen to investigate the ways in which the statistics were used, and ask questions like:

> What data was it? Observation? _Who_ observed it? _How_ did they observe it?

> What sort of anaysis was used? Why?

> Were any data transformations used? Why?

And so on. 

So when someone says that statistics can be used to prove anything, I like to replace this with:

> You can argue any point, and sometimes the people who don't know any better will nod their head quietly and whisper  _statistics said it was so_ 

Others will nod their heads too.

But it is your job as a good researcher / reader to ask the all important:

> Why?
