<p>R is a great language, one of the greatest things that I like so much about it is the community that it brings with it.</p>
<p>For the most part, it is fast enough for most things, it is also developing fast as well, there are releases of the language every 3-6 months, and there is an ever expanding number of R packages that come out.</p>
<p>So, how do you keep up with R?</p>
<p>I have a little routine that I go through every morning, some might call it procrastination, but I like to call is <code>cranstanatation</code>. I just made that up then, but seriously, it’s useful.</p>
<p>The (simplified) process:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Check my github feed</li>
<li>Watch R people on github</li>
<li>Listen to the latest NSSD podcast</li>
<li>Check #rstats twitter for latest conversations</li>
<li>Check my twitter highlights to see if there’s anything interesting going on</li>
<li>Check activity on rbind</li>
<li>Read every blog.rstudio post</li>
<li>Read every rviews package picks</li>
<li>Check r-bloggers posts for the past day, and read ones that are of interest</li>
</ol>
<p>I try and do this every day, sometimes multiple times a day, sometimes once every few days. I’ll go into a big of detail into each of these, and what it involves.</p>
<div id="checking-my-github-feed" class="section level2">
<h2>Checking my github feed</h2>
<p>I follow a few people on GitHub - this means</p>
<p>I find that this helps me stay abreast of the current cool things happening in R, and allows me to think more carefully about what I’m working on - maybe someone has come up with something better, maybe they are missing something.</p>
<p>One thing that I haven’t recently started doing is browse <code>cranberries</code> - a really cool aggregator run by Dirk Eddelbuettel that describes recent changes to CRAN.</p>
<p>But then what if you want to browse not just the current things? I have an idea that I’m working on - I call it <code>cranscan</code>, and it completely inspired by <code>papr</code>, by Lucy D’Agostino-McGowan and …</p>
<p>The idea would be to explore CRAN packages that are most relevant to you, and also to be able to browse cranberries. These packages would then get stored in a neat pile for you to browse through at your own convenience.</p>
<p>Up = Yes Down = No Left = Maybe Right = Maybe</p>
