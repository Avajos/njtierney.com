Sometimes it is useful to create alpha numeric strings. In my case, I wanted to generate something that looked like an API key in a demo.

Here's the code to do that, also with an additional argument to write to clipboard, which I usually want to do, and is made possible with the excellent [`clipr`](https://github.com/mdlincoln/clipr) package by [Matthew Lincoln](https://matthewlincoln.net/).

```{r alpha-num}
alpha_num <- function(n, save_clip = TRUE){
  
  alpha_num_pool <- c(letters,
                      LETTERS,
                      rep(0:9, length.out = length(letters)*2))
  
  alpha_num_sample <- sample(x = alpha_num_pool,
                             size = n,
                             replace = TRUE)
  
  alpha_num_obj <- paste0(alpha_num_sample,
                          collapse = "")
  
  if (isTRUE(save_clip)) {
    message("writing key of length ", n, " to clipboard.")
    clipr::write_clip(alpha_num_obj)
  }
  
  return(alpha_num_obj)
  
}
```

And here is the output:

```{r alpha-num-10}
alpha_num(1)
alpha_num(10)
```

Let's briefly break down each part of the function.

I want my key to be comprised of UPPERCASE, lowercase, and numbers.

So I create a vector with the R objects, `LETTERS`, and `letters` which contain the upper and lowercase alphabet. I also repeat the numbers 0 through to 9, and tell it to repeat the alphabet for twice the number of characters in the alphabet. This is so I get (somewhat) more equal representation of letters and numbers.

```{r pool-data}
alpha_num_pool <- c(letters,
                   LETTERS,
                   rep(0:9, length.out = length(letters)*2))

alpha_num_pool
```

Then I sample that pool, `n` times - for our example here we'll set n = 10

```{r alpha-num-sample}
alpha_num_sample <- sample(x = alpha_num_pool,
                           # size = n,
                           size = 10,
                           replace = TRUE)

alpha_num_sample
```

Then we need to smush that together into one string, so we use `paste0` and set `collapse = ""`, which says: "collapse with no characters".

```{r alpha-num-obj}
alpha_num_obj <- paste0(alpha_num_sample,
                        collapse = "")
alpha_num_obj
```

Next we have this step that writes to clipboard. This asks, "is `save_clip` TRUE? Then do the following. This uses `isTRUE`, which is a robust way of checking if something is TRUE - I don't think it is needed in this case, but I think it is good practice to use. It also reads better, I think.

```{r save-clip, eval = FALSE}
if (isTRUE(save_clip)) {
    message("writing key of length ", n, " to clipboard.")
    clipr::write_clip(alpha_num_obj)
  }
```

Finally, we return the object:

```{r return, eval = FALSE}
return(alpha_num_obj)
```

This isn't strictly needed - a function will return whatever the last output is, but in this case it felt kind of right to me as there was this `if` statement section and I wanted to make it clear that the part of the function that returned data was the last part. Generally, `return` is best used when you need a part of a function to return an object early. 

And yeah, that's it! Happy generating-alphabetical-numeric-strings!
