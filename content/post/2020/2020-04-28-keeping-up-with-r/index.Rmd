[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) is a great language, one of the greatest things that I like so much about it
is the community that it brings with it. I very much resonate with this image that [Allison Horst](https://github.com/allisonhorst) drew:

```{r imgs-alison, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://imgs.njtierney.com/code_hero_rstats.png")
```

For the most part, R is fast enough for most things, it is also developing fast
as well, there are releases of the language every 3-6 months, and there is an ever expanding number of R packages that come out. But sometimes that can seem like a burden - like how do you even get started? 

Paraphrasing Ferris Bueller:

```{r gif, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("https://gifs.njtierney.com/ferris-bueller-life.gif")
```

>  R packages come out ~~Life moves~~ pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss ~~it~~ some life-changing R packages.


So, how do you keep up with R?

I have a little routine that I go through. It used to be every morning, but nowadays its every other day or so. Some might call it procrastination, but I like to call is `cranstanatation`. 

OK I just made that up then, but seriously, it's useful.

The (simplified) process:

1. Check my github feed
1. Watch R people on github
1. Listen to the latest NSSD podcast
1. Check #rstats twitter for latest conversations
1. Read rstats blogs
1. Read rviews package picks
1. Check rweekly (or r-bloggers), and read ones that are of interest

You don't need to do all of these - you can pick and choose what you like.

I'll go into a big of detail into each of these, and what it involves.

# Checking my github feed

GitHub is where a lot of open source code is developed, and if you follow people on github, you can see if they create new packages, or star projects. I find that this helps me stay abreast of the current cool things happening in R, and allows me to think more carefully about what I'm working on - maybe someone has come up with something better, maybe they are missing something. 

# Watch R people and organisations on github

I like to see what is happening and developing in R, so taking a look at what people like [Hadley](https://github.com/hadley), [Jenny](https://github.com/jennybc), [Yihui](https://github.com/yihui), [Maëlle](https://github.com/maelle), [Alison](https://github.com/apreshill), and [the tidyverse](https://github.com/tidyverse) and [r-lib](https://github.com/r-lib) are up to can give me a sense of what's new. Basically I peruse to see if there are projects being worked on that look interesting.

# Listen to the latest NSSD podcast

[Not So Standard Deviations](http://nssdeviations.com/) is a fortnightly podcast about all things R, data science, coffee, and more, hosted by [Roger Peng](http://www.biostat.jhsph.edu/~rpeng/) and [Hilary Parker](https://twitter.com/hspter). I always learn something listening, give it a go!

# Check #rstats twitter for latest conversations

Jump on twitter and browse [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query) to see what is top, latest, and you'll probably discover some new package, or see some interesting discussions, and share your thoughts. It can feel scary just jimming into a conversation on twitter, but I find that it is one of the nice things about the platform. The R community is friendly, and if you're friendly too, you'll be welcomed to the community with open virtual arms.

# Read rstats blogs posts

I usually find blog posts to read through twitter or r weekly, but there are some blogs that I will scan through occasionally. 

- [tidyverse.org](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/)
- [education.rstudio.org](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/)
- [yihui.name](https://yihui.org/en/)
- [Maëlle Salmon](https://masalmon.eu/)
- [Garrick Aden-Buie](https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/)

There are of course more!

# Read rviews package picks

[Rviews](https://rviews.rstudio.com/) is an Rstudio blog, and they have a top 40 package picks for every month. It goes through the last month of CRAN submissions and chooses the top 40 R packages, with a brief overview of each. It's a great way to learn about new R packages. E.g., [here's March 2020 top 40](https://rviews.rstudio.com/2020/04/27/march-2020-top-40-new-cran-packages/)

# Check rweekly and read ones that are of interest

[R weekly](https://rweekly.org/) provides a community curated list of R news, my process is to scan through this and pick blog posts that look interesting and have a read. Another source is of course [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/).

# Fin

I started this blog post back in 2017, so I'm glad to post it now, but I would highly recommend [Maëlle Salmon's blog post - 'Keeping up to date with R news'](https://masalmon.eu/2019/01/25/uptodate/)!
