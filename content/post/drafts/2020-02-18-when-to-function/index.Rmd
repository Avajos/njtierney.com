# About

This blog post covers the how and when to write functions in R, and what makes a good function. I also discuss why I think they're such a critical concept in data analysis, and why I reckon they are one of the harder things to teach and learn well.

# Motivation

Writing functions has been one of the biggest "Game Changer" moments for me in R.

But, I found the journey kind of hard - it felt like I had to balance a lot of things in my head in order to do it.

*gif of the hangover maths*

I am getting pretty comfortable writing functions now, but even still there can be a lot of iteration that happens as I go from first draft to final implementation.

To put things in perspective - in 2013, about 7 years ago, I started writing some
code to calculate a t-test from scratch.

...

But the idea of separating out all the bits of my code, into functions, it just
seemed like a lot of work - mainly to just work out all the bits that were
varying, and what I should give the user control of. The cognitive load of looking at a bunch of code and trying to identify the bits that change _felt_ like it would be too hard, and I could _do it later_.

Two approaches for writing functions

1. DRY
2. Describe Yourself (DY)

The first rule tends to be: "If you copy and paste the same lines of code three
times - you should write a function".

And, it's not that this is wrong - it is very much correct, in my opinion - but
rather that I think that there is kind of this "build up" to writing a function. It might look something like this:

1. I'm going to need to do this thing 100 times, let's make sure it works as a script first
1. OK now that I know it works, let's work out which parts can be functions
1. Let's check that these functions all work on one thing
1. it works once
1. Separate out the parts of this thing into smaller components
1. Check it works
1. Put it in a function
1. The function doesn't work?
1. Ah, I haven't removed the hard-coded variables in the function
1. Now the function works.

And it's not that this process is _bad_, it's that I can't help but think it is inefficient. 

There are ways to think about these problems that allow you to work at a higher level, and solve problems faster. 

# When to write a function

Functions are __tools to help manage complexity__. If you don't experience complexity, a function might not be needed.

# How to write a good function

Your function must remove some sense of complexity from your workflow. This removal is often referred to as "abstracting away", or "abstracting along the right axis". For your function to be good, it has to remove the right amount of complexity, so that you can reason with the function, and not have additional complexity to deal with. This also means that you need to give your function a good name that describes what it does in its context. If your function is called something that is hard to understand outside of a context, you have introduced complexity and that is overall a bad thing.


Let's talk about these two ideas with two case studies

1. Functions for plots
2. Functions for data cleaning

# Functions for plots




# Functions for data cleaning

# Some opinions about functions.

Functions should be able to be individually reasoned about. 

- This actually makes it easier to do something. 
- Sure, you might have a series of nice dplyr verbs strung together, but sometimes they serve a common purpose, altogether, that you can describe.

When writing a function, you can introduce more code to reduce complexity

- example

Your complexity should scaling linearly, rather than exponentially.
