I have received funding from the R consortium for improving R's capacity to explore and handle missing values.

Part one: Evaluating additional missing data visualisations
We will explore additional visualisations that have been implemented for exploring missing data, which are not yet implemented in the R packages {visdat} or {naniar}. This will include, for example, looking at other software languages, such as {missingno} in Python: https://github.com/ResidentMario/missingno. In addition to this, we will review the existing requests and ideas that are currently listed in the {naniar} and {visdat} repositories - there are many ideas here, and part of this initial work will be identifying the low hanging fruit for easy implementations. Throughout all of these parts, we will be engaging with the community, and other key contributors to these projects. For example, we plan on engaging with some of the co-authors, Dianne Cook and Miles McBain, and other contributors who have helped create learning materials, such as Allison Horst.
