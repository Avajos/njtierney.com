I have been writing a blog post called, "How to get good at R", and it occurred to me it might be useful to have a blog post, on how to get *started* with R.

# Starting out with R

Step one: [download R](https://cran.r-project.org) to your appropriate system (Windows, Mac, and Linux).

Step two: [download RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/). Posit has invested a lot of time and money to make using R much, much easier. It's also free!

# Opening R: Use Projects

# Some places to start learning how to use R

-   [Teacups, Giraffe's, and Statistics by Desir√©e De Leon](https://tinystats.github.io/teacups-giraffes-and-statistics/)

<https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2019/09/welcome/>

# Some recommended reading

Step three: [Read R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). This is a great guide written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund It introduces the principles of the [`tidyverse`](https://tidyverse.org/) - a set of R packages that play really well together. They cover tools to data reading in/out, manipulate data, perform data visualisation, and tools for modelling, summarising models, and communiating results.

If you are having problems with getting R or RStudio, check out [this guide](https://github.com/fawda123/swmp_installR/blob/master/R_install_guide.pdf), from [this person (can't find their name on their website )](https://beckmw.wordpress.com/2014/09/28/back-to-square-one-r-and-rstudio-installation/). It covers installing R and RStudio in a little more detail.

# Learning and Troubleshooting with R

To learn R, you need to learn [how to get unstuck with R](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/tutorials/getting-unstuck/). This teaches you a really good process to iterate through when going through the process of getting unstuck.

For all my other problems, I usually google the error message, or try my darndest to ask an reasonable question to google that describes my current dilemna, and then look read the appropriate blog post, or [StackOVerflow Answer](https://stackoverflow.com). [RSeek](https://rseek.org/) is also basically a google search that filters by R related content.

A new community really worth checking out is [the RStudio community](https://community.rstudio.com/), which aims to provide a nice, friendly space to ask questions that don't necessarily fit into GitHub issues, bug reports, or Stack Overflow. You can read more about it here in [their announcement of the community](https://blog.rstudio.com/2017/09/14/rstudio-community/).

I would also recommend checking out RStudio's [list of resources for learning R](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/training/online-learning/#R), and [this blog post](https://www3.nd.edu/~mclark19/projects.html), which describes learning R from a social sciences background.

To stay up to date with what other people around the world are doing with R, I recommend checking up on [r-bloggers](r-bloggers.com) every other day, and checking out the [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=tyah) hashtag on twitter. The R and statistics community on twitter is both excellent and friendly.
