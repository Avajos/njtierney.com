A few weeks ago now, I went to the [rOpenSci unconf](), and it was amazing.

I've been following rOpenSci now for a few years, since about 2014. I heard that they were going to 

The event was coming to a close on the Saturday, we managed to get a Philz coffee (with mint! Weird, but cool!), and some delicious mexican food.

As we finished the unconf we (Amelia McNamarra, Hannah Frick, Miles and Myself) 

We posted this tweet:

> It's not over till it's over

And then there were a few other tweets of a similar vein

The unconf doesn't stop until ...

The thing is, saying goodbye to all these people, it felt a little bit sad sure, 
but there was this general feeling of "I'll see you tomorrow", or something.
And it's just occurred to me in writing this that the rOpenSci unconf doens't really stop - it just starts. It's a new beginning of so many things - friendships, collaborations, and ideas. And these are pretty special things to start.
